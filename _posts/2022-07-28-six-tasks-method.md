*This is the short version of the SixTasks method.*

SixTasks, is a productivity method to help you get the __right things__ done, six tasks at a time.

> Plan your work for today and every day, then work your plan.<br/>
> -- Margaret Thatcher <br/>

__1. Set Up Lists__
Create three lists: **Backlog**, **Ideas**, and **Doing**. Use any app or a notepad.

__2. Add Tasks__
Fill the **Backlog** with everything you need to do. Don’t worry about sorting—just add tasks as they arise.

__3. Pick Six Tasks__
Each evening, or morning, choose the six most important tasks from the **Backlog** and move them to the **Doing** list.

__4. Work Through Tasks__
Complete one task at a time from the **Doing** list. If unfinished, move it back to the **Backlog**.

__5. Review Daily__
At the end of the day, review what you accomplished and pick six tasks for the next day.

__6. Capture Ideas__
Add new ideas to the **Ideas** list as they occur. Review it periodically to turn ideas into actionable tasks or discard them.

__7. Clean Up__
Regularly declutter the **Backlog**: complete tasks, set due dates, move items to **Ideas**, or delete irrelevant ones.

## Key Points:
- Always stick to six tasks for the day—no more, no less.  
- Review and refresh daily.  
- The system is simple, flexible, and effective once you get started.

**Note:** There is nothing new in the SixTask method. It simply is ideas taken from other works and arranged to make them work for me.

The SixTask method leans on Mark Forsters [Autofocus System](http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system){:target="_blank"}, and the Ivy Lee methodology, as explained by [Colder Reed](https://colterreed.com/the-ivy-lee-method-simply-productive/){:target="_blank"}. Yet other parts are taken from works by Heidi Grant Halvorson, especially from her book ["9 things successful people do differently"](https://amzn.to/2G4Uw4L){:target="_blank"}, certainly a must-read for anyone interested in "Getting things done."
