Letâ€™s face itâ€”lifeâ€™s too short for endless to-do lists that never get done. Thatâ€™s where this SixTasks app comes in. Weâ€™ve boiled down productivity to its simplest (and sanest) form: tackle just six tasks a day. Itâ€™s not rocket science, but it is surprisingly effective (and more difficult than you might think). Why six? Because seven felt pushy, and five seemed lazy.

But we didnâ€™t stop there. SixTasks also gives you Morning Pages to clear your mind and jot down brilliant ideas (or random thoughts about snacksâ€”no judgment). And with our habit tracker, you can finally become the person who actually sticks to habits, like learning French or remembering to water your plants.

In short, SixTasks is here to help you get the right things done without losing your sanityâ€”or your sense of humor. Letâ€™s make productivity simple, focused, and maybe even a little fun.

    The team behind SixTasks is a small group of friends who believe in the power of simplicity and balance. Weâ€™re not productivity gurus or life coaches. Weâ€™re just people who want to get stuff done without losing our minds. We hope youâ€™ll join us on this journey to a more focused, balanced life.
